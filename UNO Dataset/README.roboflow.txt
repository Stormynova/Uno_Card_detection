The dataset includes 341 images.
Cards-ZGuP are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 20 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random exposure adjustment of between -10 and +10 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 0.1 percent of pixels
